# Global Reporting

Welcome to the Global Reporting Project! Abusix is revitalizing the Global Reporting Project, a free reporting service that aims to block network abuse. This project is designed to help with examples on how to submit XARF to our API endpoint. This repository contains simple examples in different programming languages demonstrating how to perform a POST request to our XARF API endpoint.
